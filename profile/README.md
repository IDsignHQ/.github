idSign is a decentralized e-signature & identity protocol revolutionizing digital trust by abstracting signatures into tamper-proof, immutable records on the blockchain, and transforming KYC from a recurring hurdle into a reusable one-time process, addressing the acute needs of governments and large corporations for stringent data privacy.

â€œidSign is about more than just signing a document or proving your identity. It's about retaking control of your data, maintaining your privacy, and stepping into a streamlined, efficient future of business operations. With idSign, we are transforming your signature from just a scribble on a document into a on-chain proof of signature and your KYC process into a user-empowering system where you verify once and utilize endlessly."
